<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[7] from 1990 </p><p style="margin-top:3px;">he listed[8] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p> And so on the apple has an recipe of delicious cuisine.
